# Contributor Documentation

This part of documentation is for those, who want to contribute to the umbox
project. The project consists of two repositories:

* [umbox](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/umbox) - the CLI client
* [umboxs](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/umboxs) - the API server and Web UI

To contribute, create issues and pull requests for the respective repository.

It is not recommended to test on the production server at tophat2d.dev.
Instead, use a local install of the umbox server with test data you can
download [here](https://mrms.cz/dl/umbox/test_data.zip).
