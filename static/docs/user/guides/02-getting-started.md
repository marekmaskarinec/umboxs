# Getting Started

This article shows how to get started with using PAK. It assumes you have already installed
the CLI tool according to the [guide](01-installation.md). To get started, first create a
directory for your project and `cd` to it.

```
mkdir hello
cd hello
```

Now you can use PAK's init functionality to create a new package.

```
pak init umka
```

Then you can easily run the project using the `run` command.

```
pak run
```
