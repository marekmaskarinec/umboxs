# Getting Started

This article shows how to get started with using UmBox. It assumes you have already installed
the CLI tool according to the [guide](01-installation.md). To get started, first create a
directory for your project and `cd` to it.

```
mkdir hello
cd hello
```

Now you can use UmBox's init functionality to create a new box.

```
umbox init umka
```

Then you can easily run the project using the `run` command.

```
umbox run
```
