# Init presets

Box can offer preset archives, which can be used by the user to quickly and
easily initialise their project based on the box. Creating a preset is very
easy. Make an empty directory and copy all the needed files into it. Then add a
sample `box.json`. After that put all those files into a file called
`init.tar`. Be aware that the files have to be in the top level of the tar. If
they are in a directory, the preset will not function properly. After creating
the file, just upload it like you would any other file.
