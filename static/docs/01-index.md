# UmBox Documentation

Welcome to the UmBox documentation. The documentation is structured into three sections:

- [user](user/) - for people who use UmBox to manage libraries
- [maintainer](maintainer/) - for people who want to publish and maintain their package
- [contributor](contributor/) - for people who want to contribute to UmBox source code

You can quickly navigate through the documents using the file tree on the right side of the page.

The documentation is stored in the UmBox server [repository](https://git.sr.ht/~mrms/umboxs) and can be contributed
to using the [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~mrms/public-inbox).
