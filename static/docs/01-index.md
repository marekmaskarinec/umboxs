# PAK Documentation

Welcome to the PAK documentation. The documentation is structured into three sections:

- [user](user/) - for people who use PAK to manage libraries
- [maintainer](maintainer/) - for people who want to publish and maintain their package
- [contributor](contributor/) - for people who want to contribute to PAK source code

You can quickly navigate through the documents using the file tree on the right side of the page.

The documentation is stored in the PAK server [repository](https://git.sr.ht/~mrms/paks) and can be contributed
to using the [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~mrms/public-inbox).
